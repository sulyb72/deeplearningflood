# Deep Learning Flood Prediction: Predicting Tropical Floods with Satellite Rainfall Data

Combatting global floods demands robust predictive models, and this GitHub repository addresses the challenge using Python and deep learning. By harnessing Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) data, the project pioneers a novel image-based approach for global flood prediction.

## Overview

Various deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (ConvRNN), are implemented to forecast flood images from downscaled rainfall data. Notably, Convolutional RNN outperforms other models, achieving an average precision of 0.9252.

## Methodology

Python plays a pivotal role in processing and modeling TRMM and DFO data, demonstrating the feasibility of this innovative technique for global flood prediction.
