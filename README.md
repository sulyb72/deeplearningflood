Deep Learning Predictions of Tropical Flood Images using Satellite Rainfall Data

Combatting global floods requires robust predictive models, and this GitHub repository tackles the challenge using Python and deep learning. Leveraging Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) data, the project pioneers a novel image-based approach for global flood prediction. Various deep learning models, including CNN, RNN, and Convolutional RNN, are implemented to forecast flood images from downscaled rainfall data. Notably, Convolutional RNN outperforms others, achieving an average precision of 0.9252. Python is crucial for processing and modeling TRMM and DFO data, demonstrating the feasibility of this innovative technique for global flood prediction. Future work could extend the model by incorporating additional variables and leveraging powerful computational systems to enhance spatiotemporal accuracy in predicting global rainfall and flooding.
